# TestVagrantProjectCucumberIMDB
This repository contains a collection of sample selenium-cucumber-java projects and libraries that demonstrate how to use the tool and develop automation script using the Cucumber (v 7.3.4) BDD framework with Java as programming language. It also generate screen shots for your tests if you enable it and also generate error shots for your failed test cases as well.
# Installation (pre-requisites)
JDK 1.8+ (make sure Java class path is set)

Maven (make sure .m2 class path is set)

Eclipse Plugins for

# Features File
All feature files in Cucumber should have the extension .feature in its name. If .feature is not present, then cucumber wonâ€™t recognize it as a feature file

# Step Defination
A Step Definition is a Java method with an expression that links it to one or more Gherkin steps. When Cucumber executes a Gherkin step in a scenario, it will look for a matching step definition to execute.
To illustrate how this works, look at the following Gherkin Scenario

# Test Runner
TestRunner File is used to build a Communication between Feature Files and StepDefinition Files.
